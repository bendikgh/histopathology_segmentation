This implementation of the DeepLabV3+ architecture is based on the open-source
version found in [this repo](https://github.com/VainF/DeepLabV3Plus-Pytorch).
We have, however, only exctracted the parts that are most useful to us and
stitched these together in a different part of this repository, making it
fit with our use case.
